# Machine-Learning-with-Spark-Streaming
#Handlling of enormous amount of data by predictive modeling and streaming model can be broken down into batches at stream them them at given time.
#In this we can get the how applications in real world modify their algorithms to work on large data can be process and analyze the stream over time.
#In this we need to analyze large data stream and process that using machine learning algorithms using spark streaming and spark libraries to build and deploy the model
#Tools  :- python3.8 ,Hadoop3.2.2 spark3.1.2
 streamed the the data set using the stream.py file
When stream strart we can notice progress of stream,time taken to complete all stream data and we can randomly give the batch size but after that streaming I

Software only converted the whole data set into batch wise
